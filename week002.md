### Learning Progress (17/03/2025 - 23/03/2025)

- **I started working on the API for a [project](https://github.com/perez-21/code-crew/tree/main/backend/code-crew-api)** I was able to implement the relevant endpoints and authentication using jwt tokens and the passport library. However, I had issues with properly naming my routes/endpoints. There are also some bugs I need to fix.
